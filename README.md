The **Apex Legends HWID Spoofer** is a stealth utility designed to mask or reset your computer‚Äôs hardware identifiers, giving you a clean slate after a hardware ban.

## üìñ Overview

When banned in *Apex Legends*, it‚Äôs not just your account that‚Äôs blocked‚Äîyour PC hardware ID (HWID) can also be flagged. That means creating a new account won‚Äôt help. The **Apex Legends HWID Spoofer Tool** bypasses this restriction by generating new identifiers for your drives, GPU, CPU, MAC address, and registry keys, letting you log back in safely.

\[!IMPORTANT]
This spoofer does not modify gameplay. It only resets your hardware signature to avoid instant re-bans.
